Q1: Given a uniform random variable x in the range of [0,1] inclusively. What’s the probability that X=0.5?
A1: The fact that x takes values from the range [0,1] implies that x is a continuous uniform random variable, and then P(x = 0.5) = 0, since for continuous random variables, the probability that x takes on any particular value is 0.

Q2: PDF
A2: Probability density function

Q3: When is the t-distribution useful?
A3: We use t-distribution when working on problems of which the population standard deviation is not known and the sample size is small (<30).

Q7: Chi-square test
A7: Chi-square test can check how well observed values fit the expected values for categorical data.

Q8: Z-test are used when we know population parameters;
    T-test are used when we don't know population parameters;
